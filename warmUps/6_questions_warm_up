1. It is an assignment operator.

3. Yes, they act differently.
-'=' will assign a copy of the primitive, but it will assign the reference to reference types.

4. .equals compares reference types.

5. .equals can't be applied to all reference types.

6. No they don't because there are other ways to compare reference types.
